        <h3>My Contribution & Challenges</h3>
        <p>
          In Wilder World, I played a key role in the backend integration of audio systems, ensuring that sound events and necessary parameters were dynamically sent to pre-existing audio assets. This resulted in a more immersive and realistic sound experience, especially for vehicle interactions.

          My primary focus was on vehicle physics, particularly working with chaos vehicle physics to create a realistic and responsive driving experience. To improve debugging efficiency, I developed custom debugging tools, making it easier to identify and resolve issues during development.

          Another major area of my work involved destructible meshes, where I optimized a system that allowed tens of thousands of instanced static meshes to be fully destructible without compromising game performance. This was a significant challenge due to the potential computational load, but through efficient instancing and destruction logic, we achieved smooth performance.

          Additionally, I contributed to the creation of elevators and worked across various aspects of the game, including animations, UI, and VFXs. While these were not my primary expertise, I successfully implemented necessary features whenever required, showcasing my versatility as a developer.
